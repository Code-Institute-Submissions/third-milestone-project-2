<h2>Swift Estates Property Management</h2>
</div>

This property management platform was designed with the main purpose of being a tool that allows the easy management and visualization of properties for agents of a real estate agency in the Portsmouth-Uk and nearby locations.
On the platform, the registered agent will be able to add, edit and delete the properties that have been added by him and will be able to view all the properties added by other agents, whether for sale or rent. Which greatly facilitates the real estate agency's internal work.
It is also possible for the agent to manage their profile on the platform, such as changing their password, changing their photo or even deleting their registration.
####You can access the platform [here.](https://swift-estates.herokuapp.com)

### Design
This project was developed with a focus on a mobile approach first. However, with full responsiveness on other screen sizes.
I used the grids, nav, carousel and bootstrap colors in this project.
The main idea for the design of this project was to have a serious and professional appearance at the same time, with light colors, a box with rounded corners and soft shadows, which convey sophistication and provide a pleasant user experience.

#### Typography

- The main font used in this project is **Robotto**. I think that's a well designed and easy to read font. An extra reason for using this font is the excellent display on small screens.
- In the main titles of the site, the font **Poppins** was used, which also has a good design and combines nicely with the main font.


#### Colours

- In the color scheme I used shades that favored the easy visualization of the information.
- In the navbar and footer I used the white background with letters in a dark gray tone, giving a greater contrast for logo information and menu options. As well as a light shadow in the division with the Body.
- In the background I used an image of the wooden floor with a slight change in opacity to make it a little lighter.
- In the boxes for adding and editing properties, login and user registration, a title with a dark gray background with white letters was used to give greater contrast.
- The buttons have a dark tone with white letters and black borders, making an interesting effect.
- Some images with white dolls were used in the user's standard photo and when the user has not yet included any ad.

#### Icons

The icons used in this project are provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
They were used in the advertising cards and in the project footer.

### Wireframes

These wireframes were designed with Balsamiq Mockups 3. These were the first version of scope and some minor things have changed during the development for the final version.
